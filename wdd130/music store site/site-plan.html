      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am Spencer Birch. I am studying learning about webb development and am going to create a template site that will be used for a music store. Should you want a new guitar, ukulele, sheet music, or need advice on music lesson books, this is the place! The audience can vary from music teachers, professional conductors, to brand new musicians! I have been learning piano since I was young, sang in choir concerts, and even helped teach some young piano students. I am very excited to put web development into action with my hobbies.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will be music teachers and musicians. This site will cover sheet music prices, instrument prices, and display this in an appealing format. I will have three linked pages, one for lesson books, one for instruments, and the other for sheet music. </p>  <!-- change this -->

          Questions about the purpose of this site:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Why will people come to your site?
        </p>
        <p>
          People will view this site to know what instruments are kept in stock. They will want to know where to find what music the store has to offer. They also will often want to know what lesson books there are to learn different instruments like piano, guitar, and other instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        </p>
        <p>
          They may want to know the number to contact for more information. They will probably want to order some songs online and then be able to come to the store location to actually pick up the music. Maybe they will want to view different genres of music. They may also want to see the list of composers for those genres of music. For example like looking up George Gershwin for jazz music. They will also want to see different sets of instruments, like the orchestra string instruments, brass instruments, woodwinds, and pianos etc. Like finding violas in the orchestra string instruments. They will also want to see the different tools that are used with certain instruments. For example, guitar picks, guitar straps, violin shoulder rests, instrument cases, new violin or viola bows, new strings, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
        </p>
        <p>
          Necessary information includes great prices for instruments or more expensive prices but nicer quality instruments. They will also want to see prices for music. Maybe throw in some deals. Like buying the set of Piano Lesson, Technique, and Theory books together means you save $5. Also there could be deals for music teachers and conductors for getting discounts.
